# Sass structure #

One file `styles.scss`rules them all! All `@import`rules here.

Two folders:

## partials ##
Could also be called "elements". Used in various places across the site. Some examples:

- forms
- buttons
- mixins
- variables

## modules ##
Specific sections of the site. Usually have a specific function, but they could be used across the site. Or not. Made up of Partials or other Modules. Some examples: 

- contact form
- twitter feed
- media-objects
